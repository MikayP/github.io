            <h1>SAY <strong>NO </strong>TO CODING BOOTCAMPS</h1>

            <p>I get it. You're unhappy with a certain aspect of your career. You could be in a industry on it's
                decline, don't have a college degree, unhappy with your salary, want to become more competitive in this
                evolving marketplace, and countless other reasons.
                You hear about this thing called coding bootcamps. Either a friend or an add on Facebook says you can
                learn a new skill and get a high paying job in as little as 12 weeks. There's no guarantee you'll even like coding, but you're willing to commit to make more money.
                Sounds super appealing.</p>
            <h2>You hear about the success stories...</h2>
            <p>"In just twelve weeks I got out of poverty and now make 80k+ a year."</p>
            <p>"A year ago I made minimum wage, and now I work at Facebook."</p>
            <p>Now I'm sure these statement are true, but what from what percentage from the classes do these actually
                happen? Very few actually. I was in the same boat as many. Debating on whether to go to a bootcamp not.
                After talking to many people who took bootcamp classes only about <strong>25% get jobs within three
                    months of their completion.</strong> Two professional connections have told me that over half of
                the people they 'graduated' with after a year just gave up on the coding job search. Tough pill to swallow
                when many of these courses are
                over 10k in tuition. </p>

            <h2>YOU WON'T BE JOB READY</h2>
            <p>If you ever take the chance to look up what bootcamps teach you it seems really impressive. Front End,
                Back End, Data Structuring, tons of different languages, and career advice.
                However what isn't expressed is how complex these technologies are. They prey on your eagerness to
                learn a new skill and get a job without knowing what the actual demands are.
                Since it's only a certain amount of weeks you only get a few days learning each language or type of
                programming. I've heard from certain graduates that they only spend three to five days learning
                something
                so popular like JavaScript. The candidate will put that skill on their resume but any company will
                quickly learn that person barely knows the basic fundamentals. In addition since the curriculum is so
                fast odds
                are you'll forget what you were taught anyways.That's nowhere near close to the amount of exposure to
                learn what's need to get a job. I once talked to a recruiter that said she now automatically rejects
                applicants that graduated from bootcamps. Which leads me to the next topic...
            </p>
            <h2>WHAT'S CHANGED</h2>
            <p>I will say this. If you decided to go take the bootcamp approach five years ago, I would say go for it.
                That's where so many of the success stories come from. When bootcamps were still unknown.
                The odds of the course work getting to where you need to go would have been super high. However now the
                market is saturated with options to learn how to code.
                Every marginally big city has bootcamps and 'churning' out graduates every three to six months. I once
                talked to a recruiter from Cincinnati (population of 300,000) and they alone have three bootcamps in
                town. The market is saturated
                with these types of developers who all know the same basic skills.
            </p>
            <p>Five years ago the bootcamp skills could have gotten you a good paying job at most businesses. You were
                apart of an elite group that even knew the basics of code. Now has been
                the easiest time to learn to code which has been great for businesses as the demands of what candidates
                need to know is years of professional coding experience. Any job posting search
                will show you how many entry/junior level roles now require year(s) of work experience before even a
                conversation is to take place, and did I mention that due to bootcamps every level salaries have gone down? The ceiling for salary for dev jobs is still super high, 
                just don't expect 80k right out of the gate, like bootcamps advertise.
            </p>

           <h2>WHAT YOU SHOULD DO</h2>
           <p>Don't be discouraged but also change your expectations! I understand how appealing it is the idea that you can new job high paying job in the length Game of Thrones season. 
               Those days are going away, I'm sorry. You're going to have to spend more time to get that job, but the good news is that it's now super cheap the learn.
           </p>
           <h4>RESOURCES</h4>
           <p>I started learning through <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> (and no I don't get paid to say that). I would recommend starting there as although it doesn't go super in depth in to each topic it teaches you 
        good habits as well as in an order where everything you learn is based on the previous lessons. Do the $25/month option. Yes that's all you need to spend these days to learn how to code.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> is a blessing for any beginning developer as it's quick to setup and learn. Downside is that it's all text based so it can be kind of dry
        but you're able to practice what you learned quickly. </p>
        <p>I haven't used them personally but have heard good things about <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://skillcrush.com/">SkillCrush</a>.</p>
        <p>And finally the almighy gods of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>. I personally know people who have been in web development for over ten years and they are proud to admit that every 
            day they google a question or find a tutorial for something that they need assistance with. Tons of developers post projects on youtube to follow along with that'll give you creat exposure on how to think as a developer.
